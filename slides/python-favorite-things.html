I went to UNC without a major. They didnt have a CS major, but they
had a cs minor sponsored by the math department

I couldnt get into CS 101 my first semester so
I took both CS 101 and 102 at the same time the second semester
one was in python and the other was in c++

I learned all the concept in c++, so I picked it as a more "elite" language

went to byu
learned c++ then java

took courses where I learned c# and lisp and python

Java was my primary language

I always envied the python pros cause they always won the
code challenge

# Keyword Arguments

???
keyword argements are function parameters where you specify by name in a key-value pair

---
# Keyword args

```python
def prettify(object, format, indent_size):
  if format is None:
    format = 'json'
  if indent_size is None:
    indent_size = 4
  . . .
```
???
example
this is a normal function
no kw args
--
- - -
  
```python
def prettify(object, format='json', indent_size=4):  
  . . .
```

???
this is what it looks like if we add the last two args as kw args

These two examples are exactly the same

---
# Keyword Args

```python
def prettify(object, format='json', indent_size=4):  
  . . .
```

???
this is what we had

--
- - -
```python
>>> prettify(mydict)
```

???
and this is how we call it normally
--
- - -

```python
>>> prettify(mydict, format='yaml', indent_size=2)
```

???
this is how we call it with the keywords. Youll notice the kw args are now optional

--
- - -

```python
>>> prettify(indent_size=2, object=mydict)
```

???
we can call args out of order, we can even use keywords for args that are not explicitly
keyword args

---

# Keyword Only Args

```python
def concat(string1, string2, sep=' ')
  . . .
```

???
same as kw args but you HAVE to pass it in as a key-value pair

lets take this example and not pass is as key value pair
--
- - -
```python
>>> concat('good', 'apple', 'pie')
```

???
maybe I see your function and dont understand it right.
maybe you just want to make it easier for yourself to refactor later

--
```python
'goodpieapple'
```
---

# Keyword Only Args

```python
def concat(string1, string2, *, sep=' '):
  . . .
```

???
you can fix that by using a *

--
- - -
```python
>>> concat('good', 'apple', 'pie')
```

# Packing
## (and unpacking)

???
packing is the concept where python packs multiple objects into a tuple
---

#Packing

```python
def get_coordinates(shape):
    return shape.x, shape.y
```
???
Return multiple values, python will pack them automaticly
--
- - -
```python
>>> coordinates = get_coordinates(square)
```
--
```python
>>> cordinates
(5, 7)
```

---

# Packing
## (and unpacking)
```python
def get_coordinates(shape):
    return shape.x, shape.y
```

- - -
```python
>>> x, y = get_coordinates(square)
```
--
```python
>>> x
5
>>> y
7
```

???
This is unpacking!!!

Instead of putting things together (like in the return) it pulls them apart
---

# Packing
## Star Operator

--
```python
def get_coordinates(shape):
    return shape.w, shape.x, shape.y, shape.z
```
--
- - -
```python
>>> w, *_ = get_coordinates(square)
```
--
- - -
```python
>>> *_, z = get_coordinates(square)
```
--
- - -
```python
>>> w, *_, z = get_coordinates(square)
```
---
# Packing
## Star Operator

```python
mylist = [*list1, 'b', *list2]
```
--
- - -
```python
myset = {*list1, 'b', *list2}
```
--
- - -
```python
mydict = {**dict1, 'a': 1234, **dict2}
```

---
# Star in functions signatures

```python
def myfunc(*args):
    for arg in args:
        print("Arg = {}".format(arg))
```
???
* unlimited arguments
* turns all args into list
--
- - -
```python
def myfunc(*args, **kwargs):
    for k, v in kwargs.items():
       print('I can do keywords as well!'
             ' k={} v={}'.format(k, v))
```
---
# Star in functions signatures

```python
def log(string, log_prefix='log: '):
    print(log_prefix, string)
```
--
- - -
```python
def log_blue(string, log_prefix='log: '):
    log('\033[0;34m' + string, log_prefix)
```

???
now I realise there is a bug in this, 
I have to update in two places
--
- - -
```python
def log_blue(string, **kwargs):
    log('\033[0;34m' + string, **kwargs)
```

---
# Star in function calls

```python
>>> print('string 1', 'string 2', sep='\n')
string 1
string 2
```
--
- - -
```python
>>> my_list = [1,2,3,4]
>>> print(my_list, sep='\n')
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```
--
- - -
```python
>>> print(*my_list, sep='\n')
1
2
3
4
```
---
# For loop syntax
```python
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```
???
no more tracking indexes
--

## with packing

```python
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print('Key: {}, Value: {}'.format(k, v))

might need to explain what a generator is
---
# convert to generator

```python
def get_adults():
    new_list = []
    for p in person:
        if p['age'] > 18:
            new_list.append(p['name'])
     return new_list
```

```python
def get_adults():
    for p in people:
        if p['age'] > 18:
            yield p
```
???
If people is also a generator then you only have one full loop
as you are processing the loop only one time

Often people try to rewrite lists so they only have to iterate once,
generators are an easy way to do this.

def get_all_adults()
