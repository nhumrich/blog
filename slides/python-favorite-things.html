things to talk about
- Kwargs
- KW for Req args
- Improve refactoring
- default values
- Tuples
- automatic unpacking/packing and multiple return values
- unpacking of args
- Star operator
- Duck Typing
- Comprehensions
- Monkey Patching
- Python's Magic functions (internal functions, such as `__eq__`)

What im about to show you might be python3 only

.footnote[Ok seriously what are you still doing using python2?

Thats stuff is 8 years old now. 

Thats as old as android! Back when netflix was only known for DVD's!]

# The Zen of Python

`>>> import this`

```markdown
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one 
  --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at 
  first unless you're Dutch.

# Python Basics

--

* dynamic typing .pull-right[\- simple is better than complex]

--

* strict typing  .pull-right[\- explicit is better than implicit]

--

* words instead of symbols .pull-right[\- readability counts]

--

* A language with a culture .pull-right[\- one way to do things]

--

* multi-paradigm

# Ok lets get started

# Keyword Args

--
```python
def prettify(object, format, indent_size):
  if format == null:
    format = 'json'
  if indent_size == null:
    indent_size = 4
  . . .
```

```python
def prettify(object, format='json', indent_size=4):  
  . . .
```

# Keyword Args

```python
def prettify(object, format='json', indent_size=4):  
  . . .
```

--
- - -
```python
>>> prettify(mydict)

--
- - -

```python
>>> prettify(mydict, format='xml', indent_size=2)
```
--
- - -

```python
>>> prettify(indent_size=2, object=mydict)
```

# Keyword Only Args

```python
def concat(string1, string2, sep=' ')
  . . .
```

--
- - -
```python
>>> concat('good', 'apple', 'pie')
```
--
```python
'goodpieapple'
```
---

# Keyword Only Args

```python
def concat(string1, string2, *, sep=' '):
  . . .
```

```python
>>> concat('good', 'apple', 'pie')
```

```markdown
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: concat() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given
```

# Packing
## (and unpacking)

--

```python
def get_coordinates(shape):
    return shape.x, shape.y
```
???
Return multiple values, python will pack them automaticly
--
- - -
```python
>>> coordinates = get_coordinates(square)
```
--
```python
>>> cordinates
(5, 7)
```

---

# Packing
## (and unpacking)
```python
def get_coordinates(shape):
    return shape.x, shape.y
```

- - -
```python
>>> x, y = get_coordinates(square)
```
--
```python
>>> x
5
>>> y
7
```

---

# Packing
## Star Operator

--
```python
def get_coordinates(shape):
    return shape.w, shape.x, shape.y, shape.z
```
--
- - -
```python
>>> w, *_ = get_coordinates(square)
```
--
- - -
```python
>>> *_, z = get_coordinates(square)
```
--
- - -
```python
>>> w, *_, z = get_coordinates(square)
```

# Star in functions signatures

```python
def myfunc(*args):
    for arg in args:
        print("Arg = {}".format(arg)
```
- - -
```python
def myfunc(*args, **kwargs):
    for k,v in kwargs.items()
       print('I can do keywords as well!'
             ' k={} v={v}.format(k, v)')

---
# Star in function calls

```python
def print_search_results(name):
    my_list = search(name)
    print(my_list)
```
--
- - -
```python
>>> print('string 1', 'string 2', 'string 3', ...)

    print(*my_list)
```

# Comprehensions

---

# pep8/culture

---

# Interables

## generators/lists are the same
## convert to generator

---

# Monkey Patching

## testing (mocking)
## patching issues with downstream dependencies
## modifying behavior of 3rd party tools
