# Building Your Continous Delivery Pipeline from the Ground Up


<!--   Outline
* What is Continuous Delivery (5 min) 
- Getting Code to your Customers Early and often 
- Smaller commits are easier to track and code review 
- When bugs happen, they usually have smaller impact 
- Testing is easier to do in small bits 
- Response time for Fixing bugs/security issues is dramatically improved 
* What is a pipeline (2 min) 
- Visuals to show a pipeline 
- multiple "lock-steps" 
- fully automated 
- List CI's that support pipelines (slide) 
* environments (3 min) 
- why are environments important? 
- how many should you have? 
- Purpose for each environment 
- What criteria decides when you should go to the next environment? 
* stage 1 
- Deploy script (5 min)   
- Lets say my current deploy story is `docker build`, `docker push`, and then I deploy to kubernetes by editing the deployment image.  
- Now lets script all this so there are no manual steps other than a click of a button 
- live code adding a docker build/push step in gitlab (running locally) 
* stage 2 
- automated tests in the middle of build and push (2 min) 
- add a section for running tests 
* stage 3 
- add environments (2 min) 
- deploy to an environment

# What is Continous Delivery?

???
First and foremost, it means delivering every single commit to production
---
layout: false
class: normal

# Why?

--
* Getting code to customers early and often

--
* smaller commits

--
* smaller impact of changes

--
* testing is easier

--
* Response time of fixing things is improved  (security?)

--
* bugs are less scary

---
# If its painful, do it more often

# What is a Pipeline?


???

A pipeline is a process put in place to commits to ensure quality is high whilst maintaining velocity

A pipeline is a lock step process, which improves over time. 

Like a data pipeline, but for code

.gitlab-ci.yaml
```yaml
image: docker:dind

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy-dev
  - deploy-preprod
  - deploy-prod

build:
  stage: build
  before_script:
    - docker login -u $DOCKER_USERNAME -p $DOCKER_PASSWORD
  script:
    - docker build --pull -t $CONTAINER_IMAGE .
    - docker push $REPO_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
```

```yaml

    - postgres:9.6
  image: $REPO_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
  stage: test

    - python3 -m coverage run pytest    

```

```yaml
.deploy: &deploy
  image: nhumrich/deployment
  script:
    - sed -i -e "s/{{image}}/$CI_COMMIT_SHA/g" kube-deployment.yaml
    - kubectl apply -f kube-deployment.yaml

deploy-dev:

  environment:

  <<: *deploy

You might want to make this its own script

# Other peices to add

## testing on environments automatically

## canaries

## Performance testing

---

 
* extra points 
- Automated tests per environment (or staged tests) (3 min) 
- run tests against the environment to validate its up and working. 
- add rollbacks 
* getting rid of manual steps (5 min) 
- CD at its finest 
- explain why manual steps lead to delayed/larger deploys. 
- getting rid of manual can feel scary, but leads to better code reviews and quality over time probably dont need, but if there is time left: 
* master-based-development 
- why MBD (or trunk-based) is required for CD 
- How this effects environments 
- why feature branches 
* feature-toggles 
- separating releases from deploys 
- allows deployment schedule to be decoupled from business release schedule 
- smaller commits 
- usually required wen doing MBD
