# Moving to Microservices
##  With Docker

???
We will talk about how Canopy used Docker to move us to microservices and the journey we took.

- Dockerize all the things
- Split up the repos
- Pipelining - Independent deploys
- Stabbed in the Backwards Compatibility
- DevOps training began
- Add new services
- Not enough environments
- Docker-compose to the rescue
- Ok docker-compose is too much
- Shadow-prod
- Feature Toggles

notes for myself on moving to microservices (aka not part of my submission)
At first we tried to dockerize everything. 
This was intially just a container around the monolith. 
Then we had to split repositories into two, frontend, and backend, then create a container for each. 
Next, a deployment pipeline was created for each so that they could be deployed independently. 
Then we struggled with backwards compatibility and had to train everyone. 
Once things were working, we then added a new service in Java. 
We used docker-compose to allow everyone to run all the services in their development 
environment without needing to worry about the services they don't touch. 
As we added more and more services, this got out of hand, and there were too many services 
in the docker-compose files, and too many files to update if you wanted to change 
your service configuration. Docker didn't completely offer the "add it and forget about it" 
that we had hoped for. To fix this we created a "prod-like" environment, 
so that you could point your dev environment to a prod-like environment for 
the services you are not directly interacting with. 
Also, we had a single prod and stage environment, but that created a bottleneck 
so we had to create multiple integration environments. 
Lastly we moved away from feature branches to feature toggles 
using a feature toggle service.

Hopefully you will learn some things that will help you.

# Some info on Canopy

- First hire: Sept. 2014

- 16 Software Engineers

- 3 "squads"

- 5 backend services

- 4 frontend SPAs

- Languages Used:
 - Java
 - JavaScript
 - PHP
 - Python

name: me

# What about me

---

# How we started

???
one php app with server side rendered php "blades". CEO wrote it

---

# Here comes Java

Started work on other services using Java

---
# Docker for local dev
## (sorta)

???
PHP app was dockerized. This helped frontend not need to understand php.
Docker was on top of vagrant. Devs still had to know vagrant.
Java land didnt use docker because java and php didnt ever communicate,
all the java devs understood gradle/java

---
# here is where I come in

- PHP docker in vagrant
- Deploying code in prod with composer install - Yikes!
- Only 3 environments: 
 - stage
 - prod
 - local dev
--- 

#First step, CI

You really cant do microservices without a CI
(ok to be fair, there was a CI, kinda)

- Always building/testing
- CI builds artifacts
- Can only deploy from the CI

---
# Having an internal app really helps
---

# Dockerize all the things

---

# Now do the split

---

# Move to independent deploys

???
At first this was technically challenging because we kept forgetting about backwards compatibility
"Stabbed in the Backwards Compatibility"

Whats really interesting is we found that once the 
tech for this existed, we were still releasing everything
"all at once", cause that is what we were used too.

- part of this couldnt be aleviated without feature toggles

#Training was inevetible

# Docker-compose to the rescue
